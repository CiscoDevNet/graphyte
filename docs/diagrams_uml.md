## UML Diagrams

Graphyte implements support for UML specification files by leveraging the great [PlantUML tool](http://plantuml.com/). PlantUML is widely used in IT for a variety of applications, from creating live diagrams while extracting requirements from a customer, to creating specifications for a design, representations of software components or creating charts of any kind.

At the time of this writing, the following UML diagrams are supported by PlantUML:

- [Sequence diagram](http://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram)
- [Usecase diagram](http://plantuml.com/use-case-diagram)
- [Class diagram](http://plantuml.com/class-diagram)
- [Activity diagram](http://plantuml.com/activity-diagram-beta)
- [Component diagram](http://plantuml.com/component-diagram)
- [State diagram](http://plantuml.com/state-diagram)
- [Object diagram](http://plantuml.com/object-diagram)
- [Deployment diagram](http://plantuml.com/deployment-diagram)
- [Timing diagram](http://plantuml.com/timing-diagram)

On each of the links above, the PlantUML folks guide you through the creation of each type of diagram. ItÂ´s worth taking a look at the possibilities.

Once you have your first UML specification ready, you can test it online on [PlantUML Web Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml). Or, if you prefer, you can [download PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/download) and work offline.

### Creating UML diagrams for Graphyte

Use the plain text editor of your choice to create the UML file with your diagram's specification, following the guides on [PlantUML website](http://plantuml.com/).

In order to link an element of your diagram to a specific input template, follow the format described in [Using Hyperlinks with PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/link). 

In the following example, graphyte will load the user created template **request.txt** in the viewer area when clicking on the "Request" text, and will load the template **response.txt** when it detects a click on the "Response" text in the diagram.

Choose the name of your UML file carefully, it will later become the name of the module. The file must keep its .uml extension.
